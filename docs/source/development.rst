Development
===========

First create and enter a virtual environment a la `virtualenvwrapper`_, `conda`_ or your own favorite (if you use `venv`_, you will first have to clone and :code:`cd` into the repository as below so that your virtual environment files are in the right place).

.. code-block:: bash

  git clone https://github.com/munichpavel/clovek-ne-jezi-se
  cd clovek-ne-jezi-se
  pip install -r requirements.txt -r requirements-dev.txt -r requirements-docs.txt
